# LeafCNNClassifier
Welcome to my repository for the Leaf Classification Kaggle Competition! This project focuses on classifying plant species using CNNs with binary leaf images and extracted features. Our model achieved a Kaggle score of 0.0634, showcasing its proficiency in this task. Despite challenges stemming from subtle visual differences between species, our CNN demonstrated robust performance. Moving forward, we aim to refine our model by exploring alternative architectures, incorporating pre-trained models, and implementing data augmentation techniques. Thank you for checking out my project!
